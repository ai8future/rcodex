# Productivity in the modern era - some first steps to getting back your time

On a gray Tuesday in early fall, Janelle sat in her car in the parking lot of the community clinic where she runs operations. She had pulled in at 7:12 a.m. The day started at 6:10 when her eight-year-old asked if she could chaperone the field trip. Janelle said she would try, because she always says she will try. By the time she reached the clinic, her phone had already buzzed with three messages: a nurse calling out sick, a vendor asking for a signature, and a reminder that the insurance portal was going down for maintenance at noon. She took a breath, checked the rearview mirror, and told herself she had to walk in with energy. People were counting on her.

Janelle is good at what she does. She keeps a small staff steady, helps patients who are scared and tired, and makes a place feel human in a system that often does not. She is not lazy. She is not disorganized. She is not failing because she does not have the right app.

Yet if you listen to the way we talk about productivity in the modern era, you would think the problem is always personal. If you cannot keep up, the myth goes, you are not disciplined enough. You need a new morning routine. You need to wake up at 4:30. You need to build a second brain. You need to optimize your calendar like it is a race car.

That myth is convenient. It puts the burden on individuals and lets systems off the hook. It sells subscriptions. It thrives on guilt.

But the truth looks more like Janelle. Her week was not empty. It was overfull and splintered. The obstacle was not a lack of willpower. It was the modern shape of work itself.

## The myth of personal failure

A week after that morning, Janelle did something that felt almost rebellious. She kept a simple time log. Nothing fancy. A notebook in her bag. She wrote down what she was doing every half hour for five days.

The numbers were not subtle. In 41 hours of work, she spent 12 hours in meetings, 9 hours on email and portal messages, 6 hours on scheduling and compliance paperwork, 5 hours on staffing puzzles, and 9 hours on the actual work she was hired to do: making the clinic run better.

The data told a story she already felt in her bones. The core work had been squeezed into the margins. Her time had been sliced into thin strips. That fragmentation is the real productivity crisis, and it is not solved by a new keyboard shortcut.

We like to point to the freedom of modern work, the flexibility, the ability to collaborate in real time across distance. Those things are real. But they come with a cost we do not measure: the constant interruption, the expectation of immediate response, the normalization of meetings that exist because nobody wants to be the one who says no.

In a typical day, Janelle touched her inbox more than fifty times. She did not keep track of every notification, but it was enough to make her feel as if she was running a relay race with no finish line. The system was not designed to protect her focus. It was designed to consume it.

## The hidden second shift

Productivity advice rarely accounts for the second shift - the unpaid, essential labor that starts when the paid work ends. Janelle gets home around 6:30. She makes dinner, helps with homework, and tries to have a real conversation with her mother, who lives with them and is losing her vision. By 9:30 she is back on the couch, laptop open, answering emails she could not get to earlier.

If you are a parent, a caregiver, or someone holding up a small organization, you do not have a blank slate to optimize. You have overlapping responsibilities and a deep desire to do right by all of them.

That is why the most popular productivity advice feels hollow. It assumes a single, unencumbered worker who can block off three hours for deep work at will. It assumes an office with quiet corners and a team that respects boundaries. It assumes a life without care work. It assumes a system that is built for humans, not just for output.

## First steps that actually help

If we are going to talk about getting time back, we have to be honest about where time goes. We also have to start with the smallest, most realistic moves, because that is what people like Janelle can actually do. Here are a few first steps that helped her, and that I have seen work across dozens of small businesses and community organizations.

### 1. Name the time thieves without blaming yourself

The first step is not a hack. It is clarity. Janelle did not set out to be more productive. She set out to see the truth. The time log was not a tool of punishment. It was a tool of respect. It showed her that the problem was not her effort; it was the system around her.

If you can, track your time for a week. Not to judge, but to learn. You will likely find a few big sinks: recurring meetings with no agenda, email threads that should be a single decision, work that exists only because someone somewhere is afraid to say no. Those are not character flaws. They are structural choices. Seeing them is the start of changing them.

### 2. Protect one hour that actually moves the needle

When Janelle looked at her week, she realized that the clinic's biggest pain point was scheduling. It was chaotic, and it created fires that consumed the team. So she protected one hour on Tuesday mornings to rebuild the schedule template. She shut her door and told her staff, "Unless someone is bleeding, I am not available." That hour did not make her day perfect. It made her week more predictable.

This is not about finding endless time. It is about protecting a single hour that has outsized impact. For a founder, it might be customer calls. For a manager, it might be training a direct report. For a parent, it might be doing the grocery plan so the week does not unravel. Pick the hour that turns down the volume on everything else.

### 3. Turn urgency into a shared definition

One reason we feel out of time is that everything is labeled urgent. That is rarely true. Janelle started a simple practice: any request that came with "ASAP" had to include a reason. If it was truly urgent - a patient safety issue, an external deadline - it moved to the top. If it was not, it went into a queue.

This did two things. It trained her team to think before escalating. It also gave her permission to move slow on work that looked loud but did not actually matter. In a system that rewards speed, choosing clarity is a quiet act of leadership.

### 4. Design for response, not reaction

In modern workplaces, the default is to react. We answer the message because it is there. We join the meeting because it is on the calendar. We say yes because it is easier than explaining no.

Janelle set office hours for her inbox. Two blocks a day, one in the late morning and one in the late afternoon. She told her team exactly when she would respond and stuck to it. The first week felt uncomfortable. The second week felt normal. The third week felt like a small miracle.

The point is not the exact schedule. The point is to make your attention visible and predictable. People respect boundaries when they understand them. It is harder for others to respect boundaries you do not name.

### 5. Invest in the human system

The most overlooked productivity tool is trust. When Janelle stopped trying to hold every decision, she found people on her team who wanted to carry more. She trained a senior nurse to handle vendor approvals. She delegated a scheduling task to a coordinator who had been asking for more responsibility. Those changes did not just save her time. They built resilience.

If you are a leader, the fastest way to get your time back is to make other people more capable. That takes more time up front. It pays back in months and years. It is the difference between a job that depends on your constant presence and a system that can breathe without you.

## The deeper challenge

We should be careful not to turn these steps into a new checklist and call it a day. The deeper challenge is cultural. We have built workplaces that reward visible busyness, not meaningful outcomes. We measure how fast we respond, not whether we solved the right problem. We celebrate exhaustion as commitment.

If you are reading this and feeling guilty that you are not more productive, let me offer a different story. You are not behind because you are weak. You are behind because the world keeps moving the finish line. Your time is being fragmented, and you are being told to solve a structural problem with personal effort.

That does not mean you are powerless. It means the first steps are small, and they are yours to take. A time log. An hour protected. A clear definition of what is actually urgent. A conversation with a teammate about what they can own. These are not flashy. They are not designed for social media. They are designed for real people with real responsibilities.

Janelle did not suddenly become a productivity guru. She still has early mornings and hard days. But she is no longer drowning in the myth that she just needs to try harder. She has a clearer map of her time. She has a team that knows what matters. She has an hour a week that makes the rest of the week possible.

The modern era does not give time freely. It demands we negotiate for it. The first steps are not about doing more. They are about reclaiming the time you already have, so you can spend it on work and people that actually matter.
