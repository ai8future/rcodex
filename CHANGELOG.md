# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.9.3] - 2026-01-28

### Added
- **Recursive directory scanning** - New `-r/--recursive` flag discovers and runs tasks across all git repositories within a directory. Use `--levels N` to control scan depth (default: 1, max: 10). Skips hidden directories and common non-project folders (node_modules, vendor, __pycache__).
  ```bash
  # Run audit in each git repo found in ~/Desktop/_code
  rclaude -r -d ~/Desktop/_code audit

  # Scan two levels deep for nested repos
  rclaude -r --levels 2 -d ~/code audit
  ```

### Agent
- Claude:Opus 4.5

## [1.9.2] - 2026-01-22

### Fixed
- **Setup wizard no longer writes tasks to settings.json** - The first-time setup wizard was writing all default tasks into the new settings.json file, which would then trigger the reserved name validation error on subsequent runs. Now settings.json only contains configuration (code_dir, defaults), and tasks always come from the binary.

### Agent
- Claude:Opus 4.5

## [1.9.1] - 2026-01-22

### Added
- **Reserved task name protection** - App now exits with error if `settings.json` contains task overrides for built-in names (`audit`, `test`, `fix`, `refactor`, `quick`, `grade`, `generate`, `study`). Custom tasks must use different names (e.g., `my-audit`).

### Agent
- Claude:Opus 4.5

## [1.9.0] - 2026-01-22

### Fixed
- **Missing grades in reports** - Removed outdated task definitions from `settings.json.example` that were overriding hardcoded defaults. Task prompts with `TOTAL_SCORE` grading are now exclusively in the binary (`pkg/settings/settings.go`), ensuring all reports include grades. User settings.json files with old task definitions will now use the correct defaults.

### Changed
- Task definitions are now hardcoded only - removed from example config to prevent user overrides that lose grading functionality

### Agent
- Claude:Opus 4.5

## [1.8.14] - 2026-01-21

### Fixed
- **Exact report filenames** - Report filenames now include the actual timestamp directly (e.g., `dispatch-claude-audit-2026-01-21_0337.md`) instead of relying on LLMs to interpret `[date]`. This eliminates filename inconsistencies across different LLM tools.

### Agent
- Claude:Opus 4.5

## [1.8.13] - 2026-01-21

### Fixed
- **Flexible date parsing for report filenames** - Both Go and dashboard parsers now handle various timestamp formats that LLMs produce: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM` (standard), `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS` (with seconds), `YYYY-MM-DD` (date only), and `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` (compact). This fixes dashboard not showing Gemini and Codex reports with non-standard timestamps.

### Agent
- Claude:Opus 4.5

## [1.8.12] - 2026-01-21

### Fixed
- **Missing timestamp variable error** - Added `timestamp` to the systemPlaceholders whitelist in validatePlaceholders(). The default task prompts used `{timestamp}` but validation was rejecting it as an unknown variable because it wasn't in the allowed list.

### Agent
- Claude:Opus 4.5

## [1.8.11] - 2026-01-20

### Fixed
- **Support for both old and new filename formats** - Dashboard and Go parser now auto-detect and handle both `{tool}-{codebase}-{task}` (old) and `{codebase}-{tool}-{task}` (new) filename formats. This ensures historical reports are still displayed correctly alongside newer reports.

### Agent
- Claude:Opus 4.5

## [1.8.10] - 2026-01-20

### Fixed
- **Dashboard not loading new report files** - Updated dashboard API filename parser to match the new `{codebase}-{tool}-{task}-{date}.md` naming convention introduced in 1.8.9. The dashboard was still expecting the old `{tool}-{codebase}-{task}-{date}.md` pattern.

### Agent
- Claude:Opus 4.5

## [1.8.9] - 2026-01-20

### Changed
- **Report filename format** - Changed naming convention from `{tool}-{codebase}-{task}` to `{codebase}-{tool}-{task}` (e.g., `dispatch-gemini-quick-` instead of `gemini-dispatch-quick-`). This puts the codebase first for better file organization.

### Agent
- Claude:Opus 4.5

## [1.8.8] - 2026-01-20

### Fixed
- **Missing codebase in report filenames** - Fixed bug where report filenames had empty codebase (e.g., `gemini--test-` instead of `gemini-chatapp-test-`). TaskConfig regeneration now happens before task shortcut expansion.

### Agent
- Claude:Opus 4.5

## [1.8.7] - 2026-01-20

### Fixed
- **Gemini directory permissions** - All task prompts now explicitly state "You ARE allowed to write reports to the {report_dir} directory" to prevent Gemini CLI from rejecting writes to _rcodegen due to workspace restrictions.

### Agent
- Claude:Opus 4.5

## [1.8.6] - 2026-01-20

### Fixed
- **Gemini timestamp accuracy** - Report filenames now use programmatically-generated timestamps via `{timestamp}` variable instead of relying on LLMs to determine the time. Fixes issue where Gemini produced rounded timestamps (1200, 1000) due to lack of real-time clock access.

### Agent
- Claude:Opus 4.5

## [1.8.5] - 2026-01-20

### Added
- **Dashboard expandable graphs** - Click any task grade cell (Audit, Test, Fix, Refactor) in the repos table to expand that row and view all 4 grade history graphs in a larger, more readable format. Click anywhere in the expanded area to collapse.

### Agent
- Claude:Opus 4.5

## [1.8.4] - 2026-01-20

### Fixed
- **Nested _rcodegen prevention** - Auto-corrects when running from inside an `_rcodegen` directory by moving up to the parent directory, preventing nested `_rcodegen/_rcodegen` creation

### Agent
- Claude:Opus 4.5

## [1.8.3] - 2026-01-19

### Added
- **`study` task** - New task type for deep code analysis that examines how code works, what it does, how it interacts with other services and external codebases, and explores motivations behind design decisions

### Agent
- Claude:Opus 4.5

## [1.8.2] - 2026-01-14

### Added
- **Codebase mapping** - New `.planning/codebase/` directory with structured analysis documents:

### Agent
- Claude:Opus 4.5

## [1.8.0] - 2026-01-13

### Changed

- **Tool-prefixed report filenames** - Reports now named `{tool}-{codebase}-{taskname}-{date}.md` (e.g., `claude-myproject-audit-2026-01-13.md`)
- **Generic code_dir default** - Removed hardcoded `~/Desktop/_code` fallback; user must configure `code_dir` in settings
- **Better error messaging** - When `-c` flag is used without `code_dir` configured, shows helpful warning with setup instructions

### Added
- `ReportPrefix()` method to Tool interface for tool-specific filename prefixes
- `IsCodeDirConfigured()` method to Settings for checking configuration status
- `PrintCodeDirWarning()` function for clear user guidance when code_dir is missing
